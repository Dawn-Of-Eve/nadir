# Dawn Of Eve: Will Adam RIP or LL&P? 

Since ages (5 years) Adam has absolutely dominated the Large Language Modelling Sphere for optimization.\
Practically no other optimizer has come close since plain SGD to the prowess and general usability of Adam, to the point where even after considerable work showcasing improvements over Adam, it still rules. 

This repository is a **reseach** project, meant to serve as a benchmark for experiments on Optimizers and Language Modelling. 

Finer details of experimental setup are yet to be decided.
